# CKBee Onboarding Guide

for a lot of CKBee, meaning new CKB developers / CKB newbies / or just some new people who get interested at CKB, learning CKB and understanding how CKB works sometimes can be a lot pain since the desgin of CKB is so different from other blockchains and CKB is so flexible for developers to coding and building apps on top of.

in order to lower the threshold, we create [Zero2CKB](https://zero2ckb.ckbapp.dev/), a place to learn CKB from scratch, using no code and no software, just plain web page!

the onboarding guide contains with 4 courses, at the end of this tutorial, you will complete the following task:

- [x] send a pkp2h transaction
- [ ] send a multisig transaction
- [ ] deploy a simple contract
- [ ] deploy a upgradable contract

the website now is under heavy developing and considered to be not finished yet. if you got any question or any suggestion, you can just pull a issue in this repo.
